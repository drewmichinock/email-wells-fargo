# email-wells-fargo

I am a Wells Fargo customer. However, I haven't always been satisfied with the banking products that they've offered.

So I created my own concept of the mobile app. Then I thought it would be a good idea to create a promotional email for the app.

I researched the various email notifications I've received over the years and decided to take a stab at creating my own emailer.

I focused on having a minimalist aesthetic. Most banking apps and emails are cluttered with impertinent details and I wanted mine to be clean and direct with plenty of white space. It also had to be responsive as the majority of emails are read through mobile email clients.
